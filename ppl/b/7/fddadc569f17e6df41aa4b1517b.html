						An original proprietor of Windsor, VT in 1763, Joab moved his family there in 1764. Joab's house was about where the Old Constitution House now stands. His name appears as "Jacob" on the Patent for the Township of Windsor. Joab continued to be an active officer in the Militia and, later, the Vermont Rangers. Their fourth son, Verlina, was born in 1765 in Windsor.

						From the Windsor County (USGenWeb) page:
						</p>
						<p>
						The first settlement in town began with the arrival of Captain Steele Smith and his family. He removed from Farmington, CT, to Windsor in August, 1764. The next season Major Elisha Hawley, Captain Israel Curtis, Deacon Hezekiah Thompson, Deacon Thomas Cooper settled in Windsor. Two other original settlers to Windsor were Solomon Emmons and Joab Hoisington.
						</p>
						<p>
						The first meeting held in Windsor was a proprietors held November 3, 1767 at Thomas Cooper's house, at which time he was chosen clerk. In December of 1767 another proprietors meeting was held at Cooper's home and Benjamin Wait was chosen moderator; Capt. Samuel Stone, Israel Curtis and Sergeant Andrew North, assessors; Thomas Cooper, treasurer, and Colonel Nathan Stone, collector. It was also voted to give Joseph King twenty pounds to build a bridge across Mill Stream. The following year Andrew Norton and Joab Hoisington were appointed a committee to build the bridge over Mill Brook.
						</p>
						<p>
						Joab Hoisington played a key role in the development of Windsor until about 1771 when he took up residence in Woodstock where had purchased some 1000 acres. He was an officer in the Upper regiment of militia, and stationed at Newbury.

						<p>
						In the spring of 1772, the family moved to Woodstock, and Joab obtained tavern-keeper's license. The rest of their children were born in Woodstock.
						</p>
						<p>
						Woodstock VT's first town meeting was called in 1773 and held in Joab's home. He became the first Town Clerk.
						</p>
						<p>
						He was also a delegate from Woodstock to the Committee of Safety and of War (Cumberland Co. CT [later a part of VT]) and a founder of Old South Church (Congregational). The current church building was erected 1798 on Main St. Prior to that, the members met at each other's homes every third Sunday.

						"Joab Hoisington was a member of the Committee of Correspondence 1774 of Westminster, VT, also served as major of Rangers, stationed at Newbury and 1776 was appointed colonel of a regiment of minute men, Cumberland County, then in the state of New York. 
						</p>
						<p>
						Joab took part in the Expedition against Crown Point on May 9, 1775.

						"That he enlisted in the month of March 1776, but on what day he cannot recollect, that at the time of his enlistment he resided in the town of Pomfret, now in the county of Windsor in the State of Vermont, that he was enlisted for service during the war by <strong>Joab Hoisington, Major Commandant in a detachment of Rangers</strong>, raised and commanded by him, which was composed of three companies--the first company of which and in which he served, was commanded by Capt. Benjamin Wait and Lieut. Zebulon Lyon; that Capt John Strong commanded the Second Company and Capt. Seeley, whose first name he cannot recollect, commanded the third company..."

						From Chapter XXVII, History of Woodstock:<br />
						The first book brought into this town, of which there is any knowledge, was Joab Hoisington's "grate Bible," which came with the family in 1772; probably an English publications, and much like the one Dr. Stephen Powers brought with him two years later, which still remains in this town in possession of his grandson. After Hoisington died in 1777, his Bible passed to his widow, and was retained by her when she was married a second time to Captain Strong. She carried it with her when the family removed, about 1804, to the banks of the Ottawa, in Lower Canada, and there it was burnt in the house of Mr. Burtch in 1840.
