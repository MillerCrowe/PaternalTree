						Ecke (Ida) Bohning Miller<br />
						Born: November 23, 1842 – Ostfriesland <br />
						Died: March 23, 1903 – Lincoln County, South Dakota<br />
						Wife of Jurend (Jerry) Miller – Mother of Thirteen<br />
						Ecke Bohning—also remembered as Ida by some family—was born on November 23, 1842, in Ostfriesland. She was the daughter of Göhe "Joe" (or George) van Böhning and Wilhelminia Reemts, whose Dutch names were also recorded as Greau and Vilhelmemeo.<br />
						At the age of 14, Ecke set sail with her parents for America in pursuit of a new life. The journey, however, was bittersweet. During the long 13-week voyage, her mother fell ill and died at sea—she was buried in the ocean, a heartbreaking start to the young girl's American story.<br />
						After arriving in the United States in 1856, Ecke and her father settled in Ridott Township, near Freeport, Illinois. Ecke was 16 when she met Jurend (Jerry) Miller, a German immigrant who had come to America in 1851 with his brother. They married in 1860, when Ecke was just 18 years old. This marked the beginning of a lifelong partnership and the creation of a large and loving family.<br />
						________________________________________<br />
						Pioneering Life and Family Roots<br />
						Jurend and Ecke began their married life in Ridott Township, where they lived for eight years and welcomed their first three children: Ailt, Wilhelmina (Minnie), and Albertha (Bertha).<br />
						In 1868, they moved west to Grundy County, Iowa, where they farmed and raised six more children: Joe, Albert, Martin, Hannah, Andrew, and Helmer. Then, in 1881, the family relocated once more to the Dakota Territory, settling on a homestead six miles southwest of Lennox, South Dakota. There, they completed their family with the births of Jurena, William, Eiko, and Annie.<br />
						In total, Ecke bore thirteen children—and remarkably, all of them survived to adulthood, married, and had families of their own. Their names honored family traditions: the first four were named after grandparents, and one son, Eiko, was named after Ecke herself.<br />
						________________________________________<br />
						A Quiet Strength<br />
						Ecke’s character was remembered lovingly by her children and grandchildren. She was a woman of few complaints, deeply committed to her family, and content with what little she had. One family member wrote:<br />
						"She never really had anything, but she made the best of it, and I don't suppose she ever spent five cents on herself. Grandma was never cross."<br />
						She created a warm, welcoming home—often with help from her elderly father, or possibly another kind-hearted relative from Holland, who lived with them until his death. The home was always full of life, laughter, and hard work.<br />
						Ecke’s quiet strength carried her family through the challenges of pioneer life. She passed away on March 23, 1903, after battling breast cancer for over a year. She was 60 years old. Her husband, Jurend, moved into the town of Lennox with their youngest daughter, Annie, and passed away four years later in 1908.<br />
						________________________________________<br />
						Legacy<br />
						Ecke Bohning Miller's legacy lives on in the countless descendants who came from her thirteen children. She is remembered not only for her resilience and grace but also for her love, devotion, and enduring spirit—a true matriarch of the Miller family. Her life helped shape generations and her memory, as one descendant wrote, “is a benediction.”

						Miller Family Tree Introduction<br />
						Jurend Miller, son of AiIt and Albertha Klut Miller was born on January 24, 1832 in Germany.   The " Miller " name received this spelling sometime along the line in the United States. In German it was spelled “Mueller.”   But we have always written "Miller", and I will leave it that way.   Jurend (Jerry) came to the United States in 1851, with his brother Martin.  None of the rest of the family came from Germany.  Evidently, the boys stayed together because Martin married, and he and Aunt Lena, in the last years, lived in Lennox and died there.  No children. Both Delmar and I remember going over to "Lena Tant's" (she lived right south of us in Lennox) and talking to her in broken English and half "Plat duetch", and she always gave us candy or peanuts. I understand we “brought” her the mumps too in her old age. Many times we went over with soup or pie for her, from home. I don't remember Uncle Martin at all. Mother didn't remember when he died. The brothers came to Ridott township near the settlement of Freeport, Illinois: There Jurend Miller met Ecke Bohning.
						</p>
						<p>
						Ecke Bohning (pronounced I-Key) came to this country at the age of 14, from Holland. She was born November 23, 1842 in Holland. She came with her parents, Joe and Wilhelminia Bohning. The Dutch spelling looked something like this, "Greau and Vilhelmemeo Bohning.”  It helps if you can say Joe in Plat duetch. Some one thought grandfather Bohning’s name was George but both Aunt Jurena and Mom said it was Joe. Her mother, Wilhelminia Bohning, died and was buried at sea. The voyage took 13 weeks.  Mother always said her grandfather lived with them till his death, and that he lived to a ripe old age.  Another family says that the old man that lived with them was an uncle, Ecke's brother.  Another family says that the old man that lived with them was not relative at all, just someone from Holland that stayed with Ecke and Jurend and lived to be 97 Years old.<br />
						In one old Bible, Ecke's father's name is listed in Dutch and his birth date is 1803, and the date of his death is 1895.  An old man (he was referred to as that by everyone), lived with Jurend and Ecke until his death, is remembered by all.  A house full of thirteen children had room for one more. I will leave it at that.<br />
						The first stop of Ecke and her father was Ridott township Illinois, east of Freeport. There she met Jurend Miller and two years later, at the age of 18, they were united in marriage.  The year 1860. They lived in Ridott township for eight years.  The first three children were born there: Ailt Wilhelmina and Albertha. In 1868 they went west and settled in Grundy County, Iowa. They lived there for 13 years.  Joe, Albert, Martin, Hannah, Andrew and Helmer joined the family.<br />
						In 1881 they moved to Dakota Territory. They settled on the homestead, six miles southwest of Lennox. The last four children, Jurena, William, Eiko and Annie were born here.  Ecke (Ida or Agnes) Iived the rest of her life here and passed away in 1904, at the age of 62, after suffering for a year with cancer of the breast.  After her death, Jurend Miller moved into the town of Lennox, with the youngest daughter, Annie.  Four years later he passed away on September 1, 1908, of a heart condition, at the age of 76.  To this union were born thirteen children. None of them died in infancy, but all lived to manhood and womanhood, married and had families.  Did you notice that the first four children, Ailt, Albertha, Wilhelminia, and Joe were named after the four grandparents?  And it must have been, with a twinkle in his eye, Grandpa named a girl Jurena, after himself, and a boy Eiko, after Ecke. I asked Mother what Grandpa Miller was like' and she answered smiling, "Oh, he was just like Uncle Bert and Eiko and Andrew and Bill (in that order).
						</p>
						<p>
						He always liked to have a little fun and always had time for some foolishness with the kids. He loved everybody, and it was real easy for him to talk to people. He kept everyone around him happy no matter what."<br />
						"What then, what was Grandma like?"<br />
						"She was quiet and devoted to her husband and family. I never heard her complain about anything.  She never reaily had anything, but she made the best of it, and I don't suppose she ever spent five cents on herself.  She was just happy to be where she was and with what she had. Grandma was never cross".<br />
						Mother seemed to have the idea that the boys were like their father, and the girls like their mother, and that is the way it should be. You can decide for yourself if you have any Miller or Bohning traits.  It has been written "the successful man is one that has lived long, laughed often and loved much. One who left this world better than he found it and whose memory is a benediction.”   Let us just say, Grandpa and Grandma, Jurend and Ecke Miller, were successful.<br />
						The old buildings of the old homestead are gone.  Now there is a new house, barn and out buildings, all modern  It is now the Klinkhagen farm. The oid schoolhouse is gone, but a new building on the same location still has school every day.<br />
						The old First Turner County Presbyterian church is gone, but a new structure and manse are there and the church is still going and growing: and may the good begun by the Miller's in the 1B00’s go on through each succeeding year.  Jurend and Ecke were the "salt of the earth".  May the salt "not lose its flavor" in the coming generations.
						</p>
						<p>
						My sincere thanks to all those who helped  compile this information.  Many letters were written, not only by myself, but by others. I wish you could all have read the letters. I wish I could have included the college degrees, the businesses represented, the armed service records, a description of the farms and farming records, the homes, the personalities, the talents, the church work, the devotion and loyalties and love of all the people here named. There is much to be proud.  It would fill several books. I only hope this record will help to keep the “Millers” mindful of one another. My apologies for errors, Mom will know that I did my best. May God Bless and Keep You tiIl we meet again.<br />
